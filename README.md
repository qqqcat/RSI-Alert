## üîß Advanced Features

### ADX Average Trend Filtering (Core New Feature)
**Smart Trend Filtering System**: EA now integrates ADX (Average Directional Index) filtering mechanism:
- **Trend Strength Detection**: Real-time calculation of ADX average over recent N bars
- **Smart Filtering**: Only allow signals when ADX average is below set threshold
- **Avoid Counter-Trend Operations**: Effectively filter false reversal signals in strong trends
- **Focus on Ranging Zones**: Signals concentrated in ranging markets or trend decay zones, significantly improving accuracy

### Signal Fusion Mechanism
**Enhanced Feature**: The EA now implements intelligent signal fusion to eliminate duplicate alerts:
- **Unified Collection**: All timeframe signals are collected into a centralized cache
- **Priority Filtering**: Same bar, same-type signals only keep the highest timeframe
- **Quality Enhancement**: Higher timeframes typically provide more reliable signals
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Completely avoids multiple simultaneous alerts for the same market condition

### Triple Noise Reduction System
The EA implements sophisticated noise reduction through:
1. **Fractal Pattern Validation**: Signals only trigger on confirmed fractal tops/bottoms
2. **Extreme Value Requirements**: Divergences require extreme RSI levels
3. **Time Interval Filtering**: Prevents signal clustering with minimum interval settings
4. **ADX Trend Filtering**: Filter counter-trend signals in strong trends
5. **Signal Fusion**: Multi-timeframe deduplication for cleaner signal output

### Multi-Language Support
Switch between Chinese and English interfaces using the `Use_Chinese` parameter:
- `true` = Chinese interface (‰∏≠ÊñáÁïåÈù¢)
- `false` = English interface

### Alert System
Configurable alert system supporting:
- Visual popup alerts
- Sound notifications
- Log file output (always enabled)
- Complete silence mode for backtesting

## üìà Usage Recommendations

### Optimal Settings
- **High Volatility Markets**: Increase `MinSignalInterval` to reduce noise, adjust `ADX_Threshold` to 20-25
- **Ranging Markets**: Lower `ADX_Threshold` to 15-20, increase signal sensitivity
- **Trending Markets**: Raise `ADX_Threshold` to 25-30, focus on filtering counter-trend signals
- **Instrument-Specific Optimization**:
  - Gold/Forex: ADX_Threshold = 20-25
  - Indices/Stocks: ADX_Threshold = 25-30

### Trading Strategy
- Use signals as **trading assistance**, not automated entry/exit points
- Combine with fundamental analysis and market structure
- Test thoroughly in demo environment before live trading
- Implement proper risk management and position sizing
- **ADX filtering significantly improves signal quality but reduces quantity**

### Timeframe Selection
Recommended timeframe combinations:
- **Day Trading**: M30, H1, H4
- **Swing Trading**: H1, H4, D1
- **Long-term Analysis**: H4, D1, W1

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Disclaimer

- This EA is designed as a **signal detection tool**, not an automated trading system
- Divergence signals are contrarian in nature - use with proper risk management
- Always test in demo environment before live trading
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Consider market conditions, trends, and fundamental factors

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Too few signals?**
- This may be normal behavior with ADX filtering active
- Appropriately raise `ADX_Threshold` (e.g., from 20 to 25)
- Increase `ADX_Avg_Window` for smoother filtering
- Adjust `Extreme_Oversold`/`Extreme_Overbought` thresholds

**How to verify ADX filtering effectiveness?**
- Check ADX filtering information in MT5 logs
- Compare signal quantity with/without ADX filtering
- Test different ADX parameters in Strategy Tester

**Buttons not displaying?**
- Ensure EA is in `MQL5/Experts` folder, not Indicators
- Check screen resolution and zoom settings
- Restart MetaTrader 5

**No sound alerts?**
- Verify `Sound_Alerts` parameter is set to `true`
- Check sound file exists in `MQL5/Sounds` folder
- Test MT5 sound settings

**Too many signals?**
- Increase `MinSignalInterval` value
- Raise `Extreme_Oversold`/`Extreme_Overbought` thresholds
- Reduce number of monitored timeframes
- The new signal fusion mechanism automatically reduces duplicate alerts

**Missing signals from certain timeframes?**
- This is normal behavior with signal fusion enabled
- Higher timeframes take priority over lower ones
- Check logs to see all detected signals before fusion
