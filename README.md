## üñ±Ô∏è Interface Controls

### Horizontal Button Bar
- **Ê∏ÖÈô§/Clear**: Remove all RSI and divergence signal markers from the chart
- **Âπ≥‰ªì/Close**: Close all positions for the current symbol
- **Status Bar**: Shows currently monitored timeframes

## üîß Advanced Features

### Signal Fusion Mechanism
**New Enhancement**: The EA now implements intelligent signal fusion to eliminate duplicate alerts:
- **Unified Collection**: All timeframe signals are collected into a centralized cache
- **Priority Filtering**: Same bar, same-type signals only keep the highest timeframe
- **Quality Enhancement**: Higher timeframes typically provide more reliable signals
- **Duplicate Elimination**: Completely avoids multiple simultaneous alerts for the same market condition

### Noise Filtering System
The EA implements sophisticated noise reduction through:
1. **Fractal Pattern Validation**: Signals only trigger on confirmed fractal tops/bottoms
2. **Extreme Value Requirements**: Divergences require extreme RSI levels
3. **Time Interval Filtering**: Prevents signal clustering with minimum interval settings
4. **Signal Fusion**: Multi-timeframe deduplication for cleaner signal output

### Multi-Language Support
Switch between Chinese and English interfaces using the `Use_Chinese` parameter:
- `true` = Chinese interface (‰∏≠ÊñáÁïåÈù¢)
- `false` = English interface

### Alert System
Configurable alert system supporting:
- Visual popup alerts
- Sound notifications
- Log file output (always enabled)
- Complete silence mode for backtesting

## üìà Usage Recommendations

### Optimal Settings
- **High Volatility Markets**: Increase `MinSignalInterval` to reduce noise
- **Trending Markets**: Focus on 2-4 complementary timeframes
- **Range-bound Markets**: Use standard settings with close monitoring

### Trading Strategy
- Use signals as **trading assistance**, not automated entry/exit points
- Combine with fundamental analysis and market structure
- Test thoroughly in demo environment before live trading
- Implement proper risk management and position sizing

### Timeframe Selection
Recommended timeframe combinations:
- **Scalping**: M1, M5, M15, M30
- **Day Trading**: M15, M30, H1, H4
- **Swing Trading**: H1, H4, D1, W1

**No sound alerts?**
- Verify `Sound_Alerts` parameter is set to `true`

- Test MT5 sound settings

**Too many signals?**
- Increase `MinSignalInterval` value
- Raise `Extreme_Oversold`/`Extreme_Overbought` thresholds
- Reduce number of monitored timeframes
- The new signal fusion mechanism automatically reduces duplicate alerts

**Missing signals from certain timeframes?**
- This is normal behavior with signal fusion enabled
