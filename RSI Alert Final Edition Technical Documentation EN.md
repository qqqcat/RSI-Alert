---

## 🔄 Core Algorithm Flow

### 2.1 Multi-Timeframe Signal Analysis

Users can customize up to 4 monitoring timeframes (e.g., M30/H1/H4/D1), each running independently:

#### RSI + Divergence Detection Process:
- **Bullish Divergence**: Extreme oversold + fractal low + structural divergence + bar interval
- **Bearish Divergence**: Extreme overbought + fractal high + structural divergence + bar interval
- **Regular Crosses**: RSI crossing overbought/oversold levels

> 📊 **Timeframe Priority**: Only 1 signal allowed per bar, highest timeframe takes priority (D1 > H4 > H1 > M30)

### 2.2 ADX Average Trend Filtering

🎯 **Core Innovation Feature**: Before signals appear, the system will:

1. **Calculate ADX Average**: Take ADX average of recent `ADX_Avg_Window` bars (e.g., 5 bars)
2. **Trend Strength Assessment**: Only allow signals when average < `ADX_Threshold` (e.g., 25)
3. **Filter Strong Trends**: Effectively filter false reversal signals in major trend phases
4. **Focus on Ranging Zones**: Signals occur mostly in ranging or trend decay zones, significantly improving accuracy

> ⚡ **Technical Advantage**: Effectively avoid contrarian trades during strong trends, significantly reducing false positive rate

### 2.3 Signal Deduplication/Fusion

**Unified Processing Flow**:
1. **Signal Collection**: All signals first collected into cache, not immediately drawn/alerted
2. **Smart Fusion**: Same bar, same type signals only keep highest timeframe
3. **Final Output**: Only after fusion completion triggers alerts, arrows, text descriptions, etc.

## 💻 Functions and Interface

### 🖱️ Chart Horizontal Buttons

- **"Clear"**: One-click removal of all RSI and divergence signal markers
- **"Close"**: One-click closure of all positions for current symbol
- **Timeframe Status Bar**: Real-time display of current monitoring timeframes (customizable)

### 📊 Signal Markers

- **Bullish Divergence**: 🟢 Green ↑ arrow + description
- **Bearish Divergence**: 🟠 Orange ↓ arrow + description
- **RSI Bounce/Retreat**: Automatic marking of key reversal points

### 🔧 Noise Reduction and Signal Filtering

#### Traditional Noise Reduction
- Divergence triggers only under extreme oversold/overbought conditions with established patterns and sufficient interval from last signal, greatly reducing duplicate/false signals
- Each timeframe operates independently with separate counting and monitoring

#### 🎯 Signal Fusion Mechanism
- **Unified Collection**: All monitored timeframe signals are collected into a unified cache
- **Smart Filtering**: For same bar same-type signals (bullish/bearish divergence), only keep the **highest timeframe** signal
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Completely eliminate duplicate signal alerts at the same time point
- **Enhanced Quality**: Higher timeframe signals are typically more reliable with higher priority

#### ⚡ ADX Average Filtering Mechanism (Core New Feature)
- **Trend Strength Detection**: Real-time calculation of ADX average over recent N bars
- **Smart Filtering**: Only allow signals when ADX average is below set threshold
- **Avoid Counter-Trend Operations**: Effectively filter false reversal signals in strong trends
- **Focus on Ranging Zones**: Signals concentrated in ranging markets or trend decay zones, significantly improving accuracy

> 📊 **Triple Noise Reduction System**: Traditional noise reduction + Signal fusion + ADX filtering, achieving extremely low false positive rate with high-quality signal output.

> 🔬 **ADX Filtering Principle**: ADX (Average Directional Index) measures trend strength. When ADX average is low, it indicates the market is in ranging or trend decay state, making divergence and reversal signals more reliable. Counter-trend signals during strong trend periods (high ADX average) are mostly noise, which the system intelligently filters out.

> 📊 **Working Principle**: When each bar completes, the system checks if multiple timeframes generated same-type signals on that bar, automatically keeps the largest timeframe signal (e.g., H4 over H1, H1 over M15), discards other signals, and only fused signals trigger alerts and chart markers.

### 🌐 Manual Language Switching

- Control display language through `Use_Chinese` parameter (`true=Chinese`, `false=English`)

### 🔔 Alert/Sound Notifications

- Controlled by `Sound_Alerts` parameter
- When set to `false`, no popups or sounds, only log output

## 📝 Typical Usage Guidelines

> 💡 **Best Practice Guide**

### Basic Configuration Recommendations

1. **Timeframe Selection**: Prioritize more meaningful medium-to-large timeframes (M30/H1/H4/D1 etc.)
   - **Intraday Trading**: M30, H1, H4 combination
   - **Swing Trading**: H1, H4, D1 combination
   - **Long-term Analysis**: H4, D1, W1 combination

2. **ADX Parameter Optimization**:
   - **High Volatility Instruments** (e.g., Gold, Oil): ADX_Threshold = 20-25
   - **Low Volatility Instruments** (e.g., Major Currency Pairs): ADX_Threshold = 25-30
   - **Ranging Markets**: Lower ADX_Threshold to 15-20, increase signal sensitivity
   - **Trending Markets**: Raise ADX_Threshold to 25-30, filter more noise

3. **Signal Interval Control**: In high volatility markets, increase `MinSignalInterval` to reduce noise

### Core Advantages and Application Scenarios

#### ⚡ Extremely Low False Positive Rate
- **ADX Filtering**: Signals only in weak trend/ranging zones, greatly reducing counter-trend trades
- **Multiple Validation**: Pattern + extreme + interval + trend strength quadruple filtering

#### 🎯 Timeframe Fusion Advantages
- **Multi-timeframe Criteria**: Only keep key structural points, suitable for right-side following and structural confirmation
- **Signal Deduplication**: Avoid interference from multiple timeframe simultaneous alerts at same time

#### 📈 Strategy Applicability
- **Reversal Strategy Friendly**: Suitable for ranging arbitrage, trend reversal capture, structural divergence trading
- **Secondary Development Ready**: Clear signal caching structure, easy to extend to fully automated trading systems

### Practical Application Recommendations

4. **Trading Strategy**: Use signals as trading assistance combined with subjective judgment, not for fully automated trading
5. **Backtesting Validation**: Supports full functionality backtesting in demo environments, recommend thorough parameter validation
6. **Risk Control**: For live trading, recommend starting with low position sizes, combined with stop-loss and take-profit management

> ⚠️ **Important Reminder**: ADX filtering significantly improves signal quality but also reduces signal quantity. Recommend adjusting ADX parameters based on trading style and market characteristics to find the optimal balance between signal quality and quantity.

## 🔬 Technical Principles and Signal Criteria

### 7.1 RSI Reversal/Cross Signals

#### Oversold Bounce

```
RSI[1] < Oversold_Level and RSI[0] > Oversold_Level
```

The latest bar's RSI just crossed above the oversold threshold.

#### Overbought Retreat

```
RSI[1] > Overbought_Level and RSI[0] < Overbought_Level
```

The latest bar's RSI just crossed below the overbought threshold.

> These signals are commonly used to capture short-term bounces or pullbacks during RSI extreme conditions, belonging to "alert" type signals in traditional RSI systems.

### 7.2 Divergence Pattern Criteria

#### 7.2.1 Bullish Divergence

Judgment Conditions:

1. **Price Forms Fractal Bottom**: `Close[i] < Close[i-1] && Close[i] < Close[i+1]` (three-point fractal)
2. **RSI Extreme Low**: `RSI[i] < Extreme_Oversold && RSI[i] < Oversold_Level`
3. **Sufficient Interval from Last Signal**: Time difference between current point and last bullish divergence signal exceeds `MinSignalInterval * timeframe seconds`
4. **Price Divergence**: Current bottom price > bottom price from `MinDivergenceGap` bars ago, with lower RSI

> All conditions must be met to trigger signal, maximizing removal of false divergences in ranging markets

#### 7.2.2 Bearish Divergence

Judgment Conditions:

1. **Price Forms Fractal Top**: `Close[i] > Close[i-1] && Close[i] > Close[i+1]`
2. **RSI Extreme High**: `RSI[i] > Extreme_Overbought && RSI[i] > Overbought_Level`
3. **Interval and Noise Reduction, RSI Divergence Requirements**: Same as bullish divergence

#### 📊 Noise Reduction Mechanism Summary

**Traditional Noise Reduction**: Divergence is determined only on bars with extreme overbought/oversold conditions, clear fractals, and sufficient time from last signal, effectively filtering micro-oscillations and false divergences.

**Signal Fusion Noise Reduction**: Building on traditional noise reduction, adds multi-timeframe signal fusion mechanism:
1. **Cache Collection**: All monitored timeframe signals first enter unified cache
2. **Priority Sorting**: Sort by timeframe size (Monthly>Weekly>Daily>4H>1H>15M etc.)
3. **Same-type Filtering**: Same bar same-type signals only keep highest timeframe
4. **Final Output**: Only fused signals trigger alerts and markers

> 🎯 **Effect**: Completely avoids "multiple timeframes alerting simultaneously" duplicate interference, significantly improving signal quality and user experience.

## 🎨 UI Design and Interaction Details

### 8.1 Chart Buttons and Status Bar

- **Minimalist Colors**: Buttons use `clrLightSkyBlue` (light blue)/`clrIndianRed` (red), white text, avoiding high-contrast stimulation
- **Horizontal Layout**: Centered top bar, buttons and status bar with left-right margins, avoiding obstruction of main candlestick area
- **Status Bar**: Automatically summarizes all selected timeframes, real-time display
- **Bilingual Support**: All UI elements respond instantly to parameter switching

### 8.2 Marker Styles

- **Divergence Signals**: Use green (bullish divergence ↑233)/orange (bearish divergence ↓234) arrows, adhering to traditional trading habits
- **Text Description**: Each signal includes timeframe and RSI value description (e.g., "Bullish Divergence H1 RSI:19.4"), convenient for backtesting/comparison
- **Auto Layout**: Markers slightly offset from actual candlestick closing prices to prevent obstruction

### 8.3 Interaction and Extensibility

- **One-Click Clear**: Fast button response, multiple clicks supported
- **One-Click Close**: Only for current symbol, calls standard MQL5 `CTrade.PositionClose`
- **No Popup/No Sound Mode**: Only log output, no interference with chart

## ⚖️ Strategy Applicability and Risk Warnings

> ⚠️ **Important Warnings**

- Divergence signals are essentially **"contrarian oversold bounce speculation"**, should not blindly enter on all signals
- Should be combined with major timeframe trends, money management, and risk control
- Recommend combining with subjective market sense and structural pattern comprehensive analysis
- For live trading, recommend starting with low position sizes to avoid excessive signal chasing

---

## ❓ Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Signals Too Dense?

Appropriately increase `MinDivergenceGap` and `MinSignalInterval`, and raise `Extreme_Oversold` / `Extreme_Overbought` thresholds.

### UI Obstruction?

Increase button top margin or move to other corners.

### Buttons Not Displaying?

Check if EA is running in `MQL5/Experts`, not mistakenly used as indicator. Also confirm:
- MT5 version is Build 2000+
- Algorithmic trading permissions are enabled
- Chart display scale is appropriate

### No Popups?

Check `Sound_Alerts`, or test MT5 sound/popup settings. Ensure:
- MT5 terminal sound settings are enabled
- System volume settings are normal
- `alert.wav` file exists in Sounds directory
