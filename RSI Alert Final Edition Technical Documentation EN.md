## üíª Functions and Interface

### üñ±Ô∏è Chart Horizontal Buttons

- **"Clear"**: One-click removal of all RSI and divergence signal markers
- **"Close"**: One-click closure of all positions for current symbol
- **Timeframe Status Bar**: Real-time display of current monitoring timeframes (customizable)

### üìä Signal Markers

- **Bullish Divergence**: üü¢ Green ‚Üë arrow + description
- **Bearish Divergence**: üü† Orange ‚Üì arrow + description
- **RSI Bounce/Retreat**: Automatic marking of key reversal points

### üîß Noise Reduction and Signal Filtering

#### Traditional Noise Reduction
- Divergence triggers only under extreme oversold/overbought conditions with established patterns and sufficient interval from last signal, greatly reducing duplicate/false signals
- Each timeframe operates independently with separate counting and monitoring

#### üéØ Signal Fusion Mechanism (New)
- **Unified Collection**: All monitored timeframe signals are collected into a unified cache
- **Smart Filtering**: For same bar same-type signals (bullish/bearish divergence), only keep the **highest timeframe** signal
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Completely eliminate duplicate signal alerts at the same time point
- **Enhanced Quality**: Higher timeframe signals are typically more reliable with higher priority

> üìä **Working Principle**: When each bar completes, the system checks if multiple timeframes generated same-type signals on that bar, automatically keeps the largest timeframe signal (e.g., H4 over H1, H1 over M15), discards other signals, and only fused signals trigger alerts and chart markers.

### üåê Manual Language Switching

- Control display language through `Use_Chinese` parameter (`true=Chinese`, `false=English`)

### üîî Alert/Sound Notifications

- Controlled by `Sound_Alerts` parameter
- When set to `false`, no popups or sounds, only log output

---

## üìù Typical Usage Guidelines

> üí° **Best Practice Guide**

1. **Timeframe Selection**: Recommend selecting only 2-4 common timeframe combinations
2. **Noise Reduction**: In high volatility markets, increase `MinSignalInterval` to reduce noise
3. **Trading Strategy**: Use signals as trading assistance combined with subjective judgment, not for fully automated trading
4. **Backtesting**: Supports full functionality backtesting in demo environments

---

## üîç Key Code Snippets

`Sound_Alerts` actually controls popups and sounds:

```mql5
void Notify(...) {
    ...
    if(Sound_Alerts) {
        Alert(msg);
        PlaySound(Sound_File);
    }
    Print(msg); // Always output to log
}
```

## üî¨ Technical Principles and Signal Criteria

### 7.1 RSI Reversal/Cross Signals

#### Oversold Bounce

```
RSI[1] < Oversold_Level and RSI[0] > Oversold_Level
```

The latest bar's RSI just crossed above the oversold threshold.

#### Overbought Retreat

```
RSI[1] > Overbought_Level and RSI[0] < Overbought_Level
```

The latest bar's RSI just crossed below the overbought threshold.

> These signals are commonly used to capture short-term bounces or pullbacks during RSI extreme conditions, belonging to "alert" type signals in traditional RSI systems.

### 7.2 Divergence Pattern Criteria

#### 7.2.1 Bullish Divergence

Judgment Conditions:

1. **Price Forms Fractal Bottom**: `Close[i] < Close[i-1] && Close[i] < Close[i+1]` (three-point fractal)
2. **RSI Extreme Low**: `RSI[i] < Extreme_Oversold && RSI[i] < Oversold_Level`
3. **Sufficient Interval from Last Signal**: Time difference between current point and last bullish divergence signal exceeds `MinSignalInterval * timeframe seconds`
4. **Price Divergence**: Current bottom price > bottom price from `MinDivergenceGap` bars ago, with lower RSI

> All conditions must be met to trigger signal, maximizing removal of false divergences in ranging markets

#### 7.2.2 Bearish Divergence

Judgment Conditions:

1. **Price Forms Fractal Top**: `Close[i] > Close[i-1] && Close[i] > Close[i+1]`
2. **RSI Extreme High**: `RSI[i] > Extreme_Overbought && RSI[i] > Overbought_Level`
3. **Interval and Noise Reduction, RSI Divergence Requirements**: Same as bullish divergence

#### üìä Noise Reduction Mechanism Summary

**Traditional Noise Reduction**: Divergence is determined only on bars with extreme overbought/oversold conditions, clear fractals, and sufficient time from last signal, effectively filtering micro-oscillations and false divergences.

**Signal Fusion Noise Reduction**: Building on traditional noise reduction, adds multi-timeframe signal fusion mechanism:
1. **Cache Collection**: All monitored timeframe signals first enter unified cache
2. **Priority Sorting**: Sort by timeframe size (Monthly>Weekly>Daily>4H>1H>15M etc.)
3. **Same-type Filtering**: Same bar same-type signals only keep highest timeframe
4. **Final Output**: Only fused signals trigger alerts and markers

> üéØ **Effect**: Completely avoids "multiple timeframes alerting simultaneously" duplicate interference, significantly improving signal quality and user experience.

## üé® UI Design and Interaction Details

### 8.1 Chart Buttons and Status Bar

- **Minimalist Colors**: Buttons use `clrLightSkyBlue` (light blue)/`clrIndianRed` (red), white text, avoiding high-contrast stimulation
- **Horizontal Layout**: Centered top bar, buttons and status bar with left-right margins, avoiding obstruction of main candlestick area
- **Status Bar**: Automatically summarizes all selected timeframes, real-time display
- **Bilingual Support**: All UI elements respond instantly to parameter switching

### 8.2 Marker Styles

- **Divergence Signals**: Use green (bullish divergence ‚Üë233)/orange (bearish divergence ‚Üì234) arrows, adhering to traditional trading habits
- **Text Description**: Each signal includes timeframe and RSI value description (e.g., "Bullish Divergence H1 RSI:19.4"), convenient for backtesting/comparison
- **Auto Layout**: Markers slightly offset from actual candlestick closing prices to prevent obstruction

### 8.3 Interaction and Extensibility

- **One-Click Clear**: Fast button response, multiple clicks supported
- **One-Click Close**: Only for current symbol, calls standard MQL5 `CTrade.PositionClose`
- **No Popup/No Sound Mode**: Only log output, no interference with chart

## üõ†Ô∏è Secondary Development and Customization

### 9.1 Timeframe and Parameter Extension

- Can directly add more timeframes (like weekly, monthly) to `tfs` array for multi-timeframe resonance monitoring
- Complete parameter exposure, suitable for optimization, backtesting, and fine-tuning

### 9.2 Signal Combination/Parallel

- Can extend `Notify` for multi-strategy parallel operation (combining MACD, CCI and other resonance signals)
- Can introduce position filtering and trend judgment to improve signal confidence
- **Signal Fusion Mechanism** can serve as template for extending to other signal types deduplication

### 9.3 Signal Fusion Algorithm Optimization

- Can customize timeframe priority weights, not only by time period but also by success rate
- Can add signal strength scoring system, combining RSI deviation, price divergence magnitude and other factors
- Can extend to cross-strategy signal fusion (e.g., RSI+MACD+Bollinger Bands comprehensive signals)

### 9.3 UI Function Upgrades

- Status bar can be extended to signal statistics board (today/this week signal count, win rate, etc.)
- Support custom button colors and styles, compatible with dark/light themes
- Can add shortcut key responses (like `Ctrl+Q` to clear signals)

### 9.4 Logging and Recording

- All signals currently Print to MT5 logs, very convenient for historical analysis
- Can be further extended to write CSV/external files for long-term statistics

## ‚öñÔ∏è Strategy Applicability and Risk Warnings

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Warnings**

- Divergence signals are essentially **"contrarian oversold bounce speculation"**, should not blindly enter on all signals
- Should be combined with major timeframe trends, money management, and risk control
- Recommend combining with subjective market sense and structural pattern comprehensive analysis
- For live trading, recommend starting with low position sizes to avoid excessive signal chasing

---

## ‚ùì Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Signals Too Dense?

Appropriately increase `MinDivergenceGap` and `MinSignalInterval`, and raise `Extreme_Oversold` / `Extreme_Overbought` thresholds.

### UI Obstruction?

Increase button top margin or move to other corners.

### Buttons Not Displaying?

Check if EA is running in `MQL5/Experts`, not mistakenly used as indicator. Also confirm:
- MT5 version is Build 2000+
- Algorithmic trading permissions are enabled
- Chart display scale is appropriate

### No Popups?

Check `Sound_Alerts`, or test MT5 sound/popup settings. Ensure:
- MT5 terminal sound settings are enabled
- System volume settings are normal
- `alert.wav` file exists in Sounds directory
